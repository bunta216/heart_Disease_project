# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
Over the last few decades, heart disease is the most common cause of global death.Thus preventing Heart diseases has become more than necessary. So early detection of heart disease and continuous monitoring can reduce the mortality rate. The exponential growth of data from different sources such as wearable sensor devices used in Internet of Things health monitoring, streaming system and others have been generating an enormous amount of data on a continuous basis. The combination of streaming big data analytics and machine learning is a breakthrough technology that can have a significant impact in healthcare field especially early detection of heart disease. This technology can be more powerful and less expensive. To overcome this issue,realtime heart disease prediction system based on apache Spark/ real time input data which stand as a strong large scale distributed computing platform that can be used successfully for streaming data event against machine learning through in-memory computations.

Good data-driven systems for predicting heart diseases can improve the entire research and prevention process, making sure that more people can live healthy lives. This is where Machine Learning comes into play. Machine Learning helps in predicting the Heart diseases, and the predictions made are quite accurate.

The project involved analysis of the heart disease patient dataset with proper data processing. Then, different models were trained and and predictions are made with different algorithms KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest,SVM,Logistic Regression etc

I've used a variety of Machine Learning algorithms, implemented in Python, to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient. This is a classification problem, with input features as a variety of parameters, and the target variable as a binary variable, predicting whether heart disease is present or not.

Machine Learning algorithms used:

1. Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn)
2. Support Vector Machine (Linear) (Scikit-learn)
3. K-Nearest Neighbours (Scikit-learn)
4. Decision Tree (Scikit-learn)
5. Random Forest (Scikit-learn)


Accuracy achieved: 88.52% (Random Forest)
